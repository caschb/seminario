  abstract = {In situ analysis is now commonly used in many simulations. Prior
              to a simulation being run, the user specifies what in situ analysis
              should be run and the results of that analysis are saved to disk
              while the simulation is running. However, it is sometimes hard to
              know what analysis to run before a simulation has started, and that
              often results in the user saving full datasets to disk for analysis
              later. In this paper, we present a framework, Seer, that allows
              users to change, in real time, what in situ analysis to run.
              Moreover Seer&nbsp;also allows many users to each run their own in
              situ analysis, in a ”personalized workspace”, independent of each
              other. Finally Seer&nbsp; can be easily integrated into simulations
              and plays well with other in situ analysis frameworks, such as
              ParaView Catalyst.},

  abstract = {The term “in situ processing” has evolved over the last decade to
              mean both a specific strategy for visualizing and analyzing data
              and an umbrella term for a processing paradigm. The resulting
              confusion makes it difficult for visualization and analysis
              scientists to communicate with each other and with their
              stakeholders. To address this problem, a group of over 50 experts
              convened with the goal of standardizing terminology. This paper
              summarizes their findings and proposes a new terminology for
              describing in situ systems. An important finding from this group
              was that in situ systems are best described via multiple, distinct
              axes: integration type, proximity, access, division of execution,
              operation controls, and output type. This paper discusses these
              axes, evaluates existing systems within the axes, and explores how
              currently used terms relate to the axes.},

              decades. Most major structures are now “proof tested” virtually
              through representative simulations of earthquake-induced response.
              More recently, with the advancement of high-performance computing
              (HPC) platforms and the associated massively parallel computational
              ecosystems, simulation is beginning to play a role in increased
              understanding and prediction of ground motions for earthquake
              hazard assessments. However, the computational requirements for
              regional-scale geophysics-based ground motion simulations are
              extreme, which has restricted the frequency resolution of direct
              simulations and limited the ability to perform the large number of
              simulations required to numerically explore the problem parametric

  abstract = {Nowadays, numerical simulation has played a vital role in
              analyzing and assessing earthquakes and their affects. Storage I/O
              performance and network bandwidth have not kept pace with the
              growth of computing power; as a result, post-processing has become
              a bottleneck to end-to-end simulation performance. One approach to
              solving this performance imbalance is to reduce the amount of
              output data by implementing in-situ visualization, which constructs
              the visualization concurrent with the simulation. In this paper, we
              propose a new software utility named "awp-odc-insitu" that is based
              on the well-known open-source seismic simulation software "
              awp-odc-os" and capable of performing in-situ visualization
              functionality by employing the open-source data analysis and
              visualization application "ParaView" and its in-situ library "
              ParaView Catalyst". Moreover, the paper discusses the
              implementation of in-situ functionality and analyzes the
              performance and efficiency of the "awp-odc-insitu" code to
              demonstrate the code is of potential use in practical seismic

  abstract = {Abstract In the coming era of exascale supercomputing, in-situ
              visualization will be a crucial approach for reducing the output
              data size. A problem of in-situ visualization is that it loses
              interactivity if a steering method is not adopted. In this paper,
              we propose a new method for the interactive analysis of in-situ
              visualization images produced by a batch simulation job. A key idea
              is to apply numerous (thousands to millions) in-situ visualizations
              simultaneously. The viewer then analyzes the image database
              interactively during postprocessing. If each movie can be
              compressed to 100MB, one million movies will only require 100TB,
              which is smaller than the size of the raw numerical data in
              exascale supercomputing. We performed a feasibility study using the
              proposed method. Multiple movie files were produced by a simulation
              and they were analyzed using a specially designed movie player. The
              user could change the viewing angle, the visualization method, and
              the parameters interactively by retrieving an appropriate sequence
              of images from the movie dataset.},

              applications to store and access data from parallel file systems on
              high-performance computing (HPC) systems. These applications use
              HPC systems often to generate and analyze large amounts of data.
              They use the parallel I/O software stack for accessing and
              retrieving data. This stack includes several layers of software
              libraries - high-level I/O libraries such as HDF5, middleware
              (MPI-IO), and low-level I/O libraries (POSIX, STD-IO). Each of
              these layers have complex inter-dependencies among them that impact
              the I/O performance significantly. As a result, scientific
              applications frequently spend a large fraction of their execution
              time in reading and writing data on parallel file systems. These
              inter-dependencies also complicate tuning parallel I/O
              performance.A typical parallel I/O performance tuning approach
              includes collecting performance logs or traces, identifying
              performance bottlenecks, attributing root causes, and devising
              optimization strategies. Toward this systematic process, we have
              done research in collecting Darshan traces for I/O, studying logs
              on production supercomputing systems, attributing root cause
              analysis by zooming into application I/O performance, visualizing
              parallel I/O performance, and applying performance tuning.We will
              introduce parallel I/O basics, I/O monitoring using various
              profiling tools, analysis of logs collected on production class
              supercomputers to identify performance bottlenecks, and application
              of performance tuning options.We will also describe numerous

Our method exploits unstructured meshes capturing the complicated geometries in subduction zones that are crucial to understand large earthquakes and tsunami generation. These up-to-date largest and longest dynamic rupture simulations enable analysis of dynamic source effects on the seafloor displacements.To tackle the extreme size of this scenario an end-to-end optimization of the simulation code SeisSol was necessary. We implemented a new cache-aware wave propagation scheme and optimized the dynamic rupture kernels using code generation. We established a novel clustered local-time-stepping scheme for dynamic rupture. In total, we achieved a speed-up of 13.6 compared to the previous implementation. For the Sumatra scenario with 221 million elements this reduced the time-to-solution to 13.9 hours on 86, 016 Haswell cores. Furthermore, we used asynchronous output to overlap I/O and compute time.},

abstract = {For over a decade prophets have voiced the contention that the organization of a single computer has reached its limits and that truly significant advances can be made only by interconnection of a multiplicity of computers in such a manner as to permit cooperative solution. Variously the proper direction has been pointed out as general purpose computers with a generalized interconnection of memories, or as specialized computers with geometrically related memory interconnections and controlled by one or more instruction streams.},
