  abstract = {The term “in situ processing” has evolved over the last decade to
              mean both a specific strategy for visualizing and analyzing data
              and an umbrella term for a processing paradigm. The resulting
              confusion makes it difficult for visualization and analysis
              scientists to communicate with each other and with their
              stakeholders. To address this problem, a group of over 50 experts
              convened with the goal of standardizing terminology. This paper
              summarizes their findings and proposes a new terminology for
              describing in situ systems. An important finding from this group
              was that in situ systems are best described via multiple, distinct
              axes: integration type, proximity, access, division of execution,
              operation controls, and output type. This paper discusses these
              axes, evaluates existing systems within the axes, and explores how
              currently used terms relate to the axes.},
