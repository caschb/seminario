  abstract = {The term “in situ processing” has evolved over the last decade to
              mean both a specific strategy for visualizing and analyzing data
              and an umbrella term for a processing paradigm. The resulting
              confusion makes it difficult for visualization and analysis
              scientists to communicate with each other and with their
              stakeholders. To address this problem, a group of over 50 experts
              convened with the goal of standardizing terminology. This paper
              summarizes their findings and proposes a new terminology for
              describing in situ systems. An important finding from this group
              was that in situ systems are best described via multiple, distinct
              axes: integration type, proximity, access, division of execution,
              operation controls, and output type. This paper discusses these
              axes, evaluates existing systems within the axes, and explores how
              currently used terms relate to the axes.},

  abstract = {Computational simulations have become central to the seismic
              analysis and design of major infrastructure over the past several
              decades. Most major structures are now “proof tested” virtually
              through representative simulations of earthquake-induced response.
              More recently, with the advancement of high-performance computing
              (HPC) platforms and the associated massively parallel computational
              ecosystems, simulation is beginning to play a role in increased
              understanding and prediction of ground motions for earthquake
              hazard assessments. However, the computational requirements for
              regional-scale geophysics-based ground motion simulations are
              extreme, which has restricted the frequency resolution of direct
              simulations and limited the ability to perform the large number of
              simulations required to numerically explore the problem parametric
              space. In this article, recent developments toward an integrated,
              multidisciplinary earth science-engineering computational framework
              for the regional-scale simulation of both ground motions and
              resulting structural response are described with a particular
              emphasis on advancing simulations to frequencies relevant to
              engineered systems. This multidisciplinary computational
              development is being carried out as part of the US Department of
              Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project with the goal of achieving
              a computational framework poised to exploit emerging DOE exaflop
              computer platforms scheduled for the 2022–2023 timeframe.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, numerical simulation has played a vital role in
              analyzing and assessing earthquakes and their affects. Storage I/O
              performance and network bandwidth have not kept pace with the
              growth of computing power; as a result, post-processing has become
              a bottleneck to end-to-end simulation performance. One approach to
              solving this performance imbalance is to reduce the amount of
              output data by implementing in-situ visualization, which constructs
              the visualization concurrent with the simulation. In this paper, we
              propose a new software utility named "awp-odc-insitu" that is based
              on the well-known open-source seismic simulation software "
              awp-odc-os" and capable of performing in-situ visualization
              functionality by employing the open-source data analysis and
              visualization application "ParaView" and its in-situ library "
              ParaView Catalyst". Moreover, the paper discusses the
              implementation of in-situ functionality and analyzes the
              performance and efficiency of the "awp-odc-insitu" code to
              demonstrate the code is of potential use in practical seismic
              research.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the coming era of exascale supercomputing, in-situ
              visualization will be a crucial approach for reducing the output
              data size. A problem of in-situ visualization is that it loses
              interactivity if a steering method is not adopted. In this paper,
              we propose a new method for the interactive analysis of in-situ
              visualization images produced by a batch simulation job. A key idea
              is to apply numerous (thousands to millions) in-situ visualizations
              simultaneously. The viewer then analyzes the image database
              interactively during postprocessing. If each movie can be
              compressed to 100MB, one million movies will only require 100TB,
              which is smaller than the size of the raw numerical data in
              exascale supercomputing. We performed a feasibility study using the
              proposed method. Multiple movie files were produced by a simulation
              and they were analyzed using a specially designed movie player. The
              user could change the viewing angle, the visualization method, and
              the parameters interactively by retrieving an appropriate sequence
              of images from the movie dataset.},
